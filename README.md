# GPXRide

GPXRide is a small tool to convert GPX Track/Routes/Waypoint to a [MV Ride](https://www.mvagusta.com/de/en/mv-ride-app) compatible format.
GPXRide is powered by Blazor Webassembly and runs just in your Browser - no seperate Installation etc. is needed. Also GPXRide is [PWA](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_App) enabled so you can "install" GPXRide on any device.

# About

Since the MV Agusta MV Ride App does not allow advanced route planning like kurviger.de I wrote this little tool which allows you to create a tour on your PC with any route planner and convert it from GPX to a MV Ride compatible format (mviniternary).
